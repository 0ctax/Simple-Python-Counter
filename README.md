# Simple Python Counter
Hello everyone,

This is a very simple Counter I have created while watching a Youtuber / Streamer HDvee95 and I thought I might aswell make a counter since he makes Pokemon Shiny Hunting Streams.

Use:

Use "+" to add 1 to the counter,
Use "-" to remove 1 from the counter,
use "--" to clear the counter,


(This Counter cant go below 0)
